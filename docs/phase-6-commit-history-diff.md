- Rename detection
- Unified diff
- Binary diff handling
- Large diff limits
- Compare commits
- Compare branches
- Private repository authorization
- Invalid revision handling
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Real HTTP E2E verification
- Performance verification
- Full quality gate

## API Endpoints

```text
GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/commits
GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/commits/:sha
GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/commits/:sha/diff
GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/compare/commits
GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/compare/branches
```

## Commit History

Commit history supports:

- repository revision selection
- page/perPage pagination
- optional path filtering
- author metadata
- committer metadata
- parent commit SHAs

## Commit Details

Commit details include:

- SHA
- author
- committer
- commit message
- parents
- additions
- deletions
- files changed
- changed file status
- previous path for renamed files
- binary-file detection

## Diff

Unified diff responses include:

- diff content
- UTF-8 byte size
- truncation state
- binary state

Diff output is bounded by an API-level byte limit and the configured Git subprocess output limit.

## Compare

Commit and branch comparison includes:

- base revision
- head revision
- merge base
- ahead count
- behind count
- unified diff
- binary diff detection

Branch comparison uses exact repository branch refs.

## Security

- Repository read authorization is enforced before Git content is exposed.
- Anonymous access to private repository commit data is rejected.
- Commit SHA input is validated before Git execution.
- Branch refs use safe Git ref validation.
- Git commands run inside the configured repository storage boundary.
- Git read commands use configured timeout and output limits.

## Verification

Phase 6 was verified with:

- unit tests
- integration tests
- real bare Git repository fixtures
- real HTTP E2E requests
- private repository authorization test
- history performance test
- diff performance test
- TypeScript source typecheck
- TypeScript test typecheck
- ESLint
- full Vitest suite

Final full quality gate:

```text
Test Files: 62 passed
Tests:      670 passed
```

## Performance Verification

Real HTTP fixture measurements:

```text
History requests: 25
History average:  138.87 ms
History p95:      179.36 ms
History maximum:  205.84 ms

Diff requests:    15
Diff average:     61.42 ms
Diff p95:         81.43 ms
Diff maximum:     81.43 ms
```

These measurements are development-environment verification results, not production performance guarantees.

## Completion

Phase 6 commit history and diff functionality is complete and verified.
