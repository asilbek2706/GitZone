# Phase 8 - Code Review

## Overview

Phase 8 introduces Git-backed pull request reviews, general and inline comments, review decisions, and conversation management.

## Implemented Features

- Pull request reviews: COMMENTED, APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED.
- General pull request comments.
- Inline comments anchored to actual Git diff lines.
- Reply to review conversations.
- Edit and delete own comments.
- Resolve and reopen conversations.
- Detect outdated inline comments after source branch updates.
- Invalidate stale approvals when the source commit changes.
- Calculate the current review state using the latest actionable review per reviewer.
- Enforce repository permissions and author/reviewer restrictions.

## Authentication and Authorization

- API endpoints use authenticated access.
- Repository READ access permits commenting.
- Repository WRITE access is required for actionable reviews and conversation resolution.
- Pull request authors cannot approve their own pull requests or request changes on them.
- Only a comment author can edit or delete that comment.
