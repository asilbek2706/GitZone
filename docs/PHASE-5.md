# Phase 5 — Branch Management

## Status

**PHASE 5 — implementation and verification complete; final commit/push pending.**

## Implemented

- Branch listing
- Branch details
- Default branch resolution
- Branch creation
- Branch deletion
- Branch rename
- Protected default branch rules
- Invalid ref-name protection
- Git-native ref validation
- Repository authorization
- Concurrent branch operation protection

## API

- GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/branches
- GET /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/branches/details?name=<branch>
- POST /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/branches
- PATCH /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/branches
- DELETE /api/repositories/:username/:name/git/branches?name=<branch>

Branch mutations require authenticated WRITE access.

The default branch cannot be renamed or deleted.

Branch names are validated by GitZone and by native Git check-ref-format.

Creation, rename and deletion use atomic Git ref operations and expected OIDs to protect against concurrent/stale mutations.
