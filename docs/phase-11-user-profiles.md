# GitZone - Phase 11: User Profiles

## Overview
Phase 11 provides public profiles, authenticated profile updates, avatars,
public repositories, activity, and contributions.

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/users/:username | Public |
| PATCH | /api/users/me | JWT |
| PATCH | /api/users/me/avatar | JWT |
| GET | /api/users/avatars/:filename | Public |
| GET | /api/users/:username/repositories | Public |
| GET | /api/users/:username/activity | Public |
| GET | /api/users/:username/contributions | Public |

## Profile Updates
PATCH /api/users/me accepts JSON containing at least one field.
Allowed fields: username, name, bio, location, website.
Username: 3-30 characters, letters, digits, underscore, hyphen.
Name: 1-100 trimmed characters or null.

## Avatar Upload
PATCH /api/users/me/avatar requires Bearer JWT.

Accepted input formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP.
Maximum upload size: 5 MiB.
Images are validated and re-encoded as WebP.
Output dimensions fit within 512 x 512 pixels.
Animated images and unsafe image metadata are rejected.

## Avatar Retrieval
GET /api/users/avatars/:filename returns image/webp.
Filenames are UUID-based and end in .webp.
Filesystem checks reject unsafe paths and symbolic links.
Avatar storage is isolated from Git repository storage.

## Privacy
Public profile responses explicitly select permitted fields.
Private repositories are excluded from public repository listings.
Activity and contribution calculations exclude private repositories.

## Security
Profile mutations require authentication.
Profile JSON uses strict Zod validation.
Avatar uploads enforce MIME, size, and decoded-image validation.
Avatar replacement uses optimistic concurrency protection.
Old unreferenced local avatars are cleaned up after replacement.
